- [x] (2pts) Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
- [x] (2pts) For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones.

<img src="horizontal.gif" width=250><br><img src="vertical.gif" height=250><br>

### Notes
When building this app, the most challenge part is how to align image size to fill the entire ImageView and match image size among all images within different ViewHolder.

### Open-source libraries used
